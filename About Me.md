# About me

Hey! 
I’m James Cerniglia. I’m currently a Junior studying computer science. I’ve enjoyed taking computer science I, II, and III as well as Computer Architecture. I feel comfortable using eclipse or any other Java designated development tool as Java is the language I have the most experience with (unfortunately we won’t use it in Web Programming). I’ve built many projects involving game development with java. These projects contained many complex concepts such as servers, clients, portforwarding, player saving, packet handling, interface handling, button handling as well as many others. There’s many things i expect to take away from this class. Having absolutely no/little experience with html/css, I hopefully can walk away with a strong understanding of the development of websites, etc. I am also interested in the app project. I love working out and having healthy habits, like calorie counting, so I'm excited to possibly walk away developing an app that is able to do the things I love.
